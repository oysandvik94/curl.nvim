curl.nvimallows you to run HTTP requests with curl from a scratchpad, and
display the formatted output

The scratch buffer can be persisted on a per-directory basis, globally, or in
named files.

The plugin aims to be 100% compatible with curl; if a curl command can execute
in your shell, you will be able to paste it in to the scratch buffer and run
it. Because of this, the plugin attempts to get the balance of being ergonomic
and convenient, while still using the knowledge of curl you already have.

However, there are a few quality of life features enabled in the scratch
buffer, so that you dont have to write out curl commands as if they were valid
bash.


INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS        *curl.nvim-installation-and-requirements*

The plugin requires you to have curl on your system, which you most likely
have.

If you dont have jq <https://jqlang.github.io/jq/>, you can most likely
download it on your system through your preferred package manager. _curl.nvim_
uses jq to format JSON, but it’s an amazing tool that I recommend you
experiment with.

Installation example for Lazy <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>

>lua
    {
      "oysandvik94/curl.nvim",
      dependencies = {
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
      },
      config = function()
        require("curl").setup({})
      end
    }
<

Toverify the installation run `:checkhealth curl`.


CONFIGURATION                                        *curl.nvim-configuration*

You can configure curl.nvim by running the `curl.setup()` function, passing a
table as the argument.

Default Config ~

>lua
    local curl = require("curl").setup()
    
    curl.setup {
        mappings = {
            execute_curl = "<CR>"
        }
    }
<


USAGE                                                        *curl.nvim-usage*

You can open curl.nvim in three ways:

>vim
    " A buffer that is scoped to the current working directory
    :CurlOpen
    
    " A global buffer that will be the same for all Neovim instances
    :CurlOpen global
    
    " A buffer with a custom name that can be opened from any Neovim instance
    :CurlOpen custom {any_name}
<

or using the lua api:

>lua
    require("curl").open_curl_tab()
    require("curl").open_global_tab()
    require("curl").open_custom_tab("my_curls")
<

Any of these commands will open a new tab containing two buffers split
vertically.

In the left buffer, you can paste or write curl commands, and by pressing
Enter, the command will execute, and the output will be shown and formatted in
the rightmost buffer.

If you wish, you can select the text in the right buffer, and filter it using
jq, i.e. `ggVG! jq '{query goes here}'`

See examples under Features <README#✨%20Features> for more information


FEATURES                                                  *curl.nvim-features*


FORMATTING ~


NO QUOTES NEEDED

JSON bodies do not have to be wrapped in quotes, making it easier to format
JSON with JQ (va{:!jq)

See example ~

>bash
    curl -X POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d
    {
      "id": 2
      "title": "now try this"
    }
<


NO TRAILING \

You dont need a trailing \, but it wont matter if they are there, making it
easier to copy-paste requests

See example ~

>bash
    curl -X POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"title": "now try this"}'
<


COMMENT OUT LINES

Headers and/or parts of the body can be commented out using '#', making ad-hoc
experimenting with requests easier

See example ~

>bash
    curl -X POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d
    {
      # "title": "remember me"
      "title": "now try this"
    }
<


HEADERS ~

Basic auth and bearer tokens work, and can be retrieved from environment
variables


  [!CAUTION] The command scratch buffer is stored in plaintext in your Neovim
  data directory, be careful when using literal secrets!
See example ~

>bash
    curl -u "username:password" http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/username/password
    
    curl -u "username:$PASSWORD_TEST" http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/username/mypassword
    
    curl -X GET "https://httpbin.org/bearer" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer myrandomtoken"
    
    curl -X GET "https://httpbin.org/bearer" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_TEST"
<


PERSISTENCE ~

There are multiple ways to work with the scratch buffers, so you can tailor it
to your own workflow.


PER DIRECTORY

Running `:CurlOpen` or `require("curl").open_curl_tab()` will open a command
buffer that is tied to your current working directory. If you open neovim in a
different directory, a different set of commands will be shown.

If you treat directories as "projects", and always open neovim in the root of
your project directories, then this option might be useful for you.


GLOBAL BUFFERS

If you want your curl commands to always be available, regardless of where you
launch Neovim from, use the global option.

>vim
    :CurlOpen global
<

>lua
    require("curl").open_global_tab()
<


CUSTOM BUFFERS

If you want more control, or would like to organize your curl commands in
logical collections, you can use the custom option to give names to your
collections.

Next time you run `CurlOpen` with that given names, you will find your commands
again.

>vim
    :CurlOpen custom mycoolcurls
<

>lua
    require("curl").open_custom_tab("mycoolcurls")
<


LUA API                                                    *curl.nvim-lua-api*

The plugin also exposes this lua api:

See lua api ~

>lua
    local curl = require('curl')
    
    -- See ### Persistence under ## Features
    curl.open_curl_tab()
    curl.open_global_tab()
    curl.open_custom_tab()
    
    -- Close the tab containing curl buffers
    curl.close_curl_tab()
    
    -- Executes the curl command under the cursor when the command buffer is open
    -- Also executed by the "execute_curl" mapping, as seen in the configuration. Mapped to <CR> by default
    curl.execute_curl()
<


FUTURE PLANS                                          *curl.nvim-future-plans*

Interesting features that might arrive soon:

- Format JSON under the cursor in the scratch window with a single keybind
- Be able to do simple jq queries in the output window. For example: while the cursor is
    on a key in the json, execute a keybind to filter the entire json for that key
- Enhance organization, by maybe folds, creating a picker for commands in the scratch,
    or multiple named scratches


ALTERNATIVES                                          *curl.nvim-alternatives*

- rest.nvim <https://github.com/rest-nvim/rest.nvim> has a similar UI, using HTTP file syntax instead.
    This is similar to Jetbrains HTTP clien
